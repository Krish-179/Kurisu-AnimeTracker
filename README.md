# Kurisu-AnimeTracker
AnimeTracker is an Android app that helps you manage, track, and update your anime progress seamlessly.   It integrates with MyAnimeList (MAL) and AniList APIs, automatically updating your list when an episode is 90% watched.
This is my first big project built with *Jetpack Compose*.
